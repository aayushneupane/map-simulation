# map-simulation
The purpose of this project is to simulate a vehicle out for delivery between a grocery store and a user given location. 
The map contains ten virtual locations (2 per county in SF bay area). Once a user enters an address, the program checks if the location is within five counties of bay area. Then it checks the closest virtual location based on distance, and simulates a delivery truck out on delivery. 

The demo was built using Google Maps Javascript API, HTML5, Bootstrap.

This demo was originally built for Software Engineering (CS160) class for SJSU.
